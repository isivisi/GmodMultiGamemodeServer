# Gmod Multi Gamemode Server
Script for running multiple gamemodes in one server automatically

# Setup
Place the lua script into your garrysmod/lua folder, then add this line to your garrysmod/cfg/server.cfg file:

```lua_openscript SetGameMode.lua```

Now the script will run every time the server changes levels and swap gamemodes based on what map is currently running.
